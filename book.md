# Democratic School Manifesto

This will detail the philosphical reasons for supporting democratic education.
No attempt will be made in this document to argue that this is of utilitarian
benefit. There is plenty of evidence that this is the case, but that's beside
the point of this document. 

The focus and inspiration is the Sudbury model. But these points no doubt
apply to other models.

From "Why Don't Students Like School"

* People are naturally curious, but they are not naturally good thinkers
    1. We like challenges that are just right -- not too hard, not too easy.
    2. We do not like being given instructions.
    3. We are optimized for recall. Things we need to do are put into memory
       for quick and easy retrieval.
    4. We are pattern matchers.
    5. We have very limited working memory, maybe 5 or 6 things.
* Factual knowledge precedes skill.
    1. Chunking essential to getting "more" working memory.
    2. Chunking happens after much accumulation of knowledge. Example a list
       of jumbled letters is hard to remember, but if they consist of CNN,
       PHD, FBI, ... etc., then we can remember more letters as part of the 5
       or 6 acronyms we are remembering. 
    3. The same abstract problem can be hard if surface layer consists of
       nothing concrete. 
    4. Master chess players remember about 50,000 game boards. Long term
       memory pulls out relevant possible future moves, working memory
       selects. 
    5. The more you know, the more you can take in. So if you are ahead of
       someone else, then you get farther ahead simply by virtue of having
       that initial gap and you can go faster since you already know some
       stuff.
    6. Reading has been found to be far more influential in getting background
       knowledge of academics (vocab, different ideas). 
    7. List learning is not so good...
* Memory is the residue of thought.
    1. Thinking is the trigger to store a memory. 
    2. Context determines what facet of a thing gets stored. 
    3. Lessons often go awry as they get students to go in different
       directions. 
    4. Stories are powerful. 4 C's: Causality (the causal link should be
       clear), conflict (difficulty in reaching main goal), complications
       (subproblems that arise), characters (interesting, actions speak).
    5. Start with something to acquaint, then get into the deep matter. 
* We understand new things in the context we already know.
    1. We learn by concrete problems, making connections with what is already
       familiar to us. 
    2. Seeing the deep structure is not easy. It takes practice with lots of
       problems. The brain is probably using "deep structure" as a shortcut
       for storage. Remember, the goal is to get memory retrieval instead of
       thinking as the primary mode of being. 
* Proficiency requires practice.
    1. The lack of working memory is the bottleneck in human cognition.
    2. Practice makes stuff either chunkable or automatic, depending on what
       it is. 
    3. Practice makes memory last longer.
    4. Additional levels of understanding above a level improves memory.
    5. Practice increases chance of transfer of understanding. 
* Cognition is fundamentally different eary and late in training.
    1. Novices group things superficially.
    2. Experts group things on the deep structure. What is used to solve it
       rather than superficial characteristics.
    3. Experts ignore irrelevant details. Novices do not yet know what to
       ignore.
    4. Practice and experience drive the novice to expert. Just got to do a
       lot and reflect and practice.
    5. Again chunking and automatic processes are key to smooth, quick
       thinking.
    6. Not reasonable to have students think like an expert in terms of coming
       up with solutions, etc. But it seems to me exploring is key.
    7. Criticizes science projects as being lousy and not very learning in
       terms of scientific method and fundamental questions, but can be very
       creative and proud. Seems to me that the problem is that this is a
       one-off kind of thing. Repeatedly investigating and exploring would
       establish a background knowledge that could then be built on with the
       experience of others. First learn on your own by exploring and doing.
       Then if of interest, seek out the knowledge of others. Practice,
       refine, and then finally contribute original stuff. 
* Children are more alike than different in terms of learning.
    1. Cognitive styles are BS. 
    2. Some material is more visual or auditory than others and those who have
       better memories of that kind of stuff will do better with it. But
       conventing non-visual stuff into visual does not work. The core idea
       would need to be the part that matters. 
* Intelligence can be changed through sustained hard work.
    1. Genetics can influence choices (tall separated twins both choosing to
       do basketball), but it is the sustained practice that makes one great at
       something.
    2. There is a general intelligence factor, probably facility with working
       memory which seems fixed. But this can be gotten around by chunking and
       other knowledge-based stuff.
    3. Most great scholars and atheletes, etc., are work-aholics. This means
       they are doing much more "practice" than the rest of us. 
    4. Effort, not success is key. Need students to believe that intelligence
       is earned, not given by genetics. A "dumb" student can be just as good
       as a "smart" student given enough practice and work time on something.
       Me: So why grade? 
    5. Failure is important and natural to the learning process.
* Practice
    1. Consciously trying to improve; experience is insufficient.
    2. Seeking feedback
    3. Undetaking activities for the sake of improvement, possibly seemingly
       unrelated.
