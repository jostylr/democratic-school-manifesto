# Democratic School Manifesto

This will detail the philosphical reasons for supporting democratic education.
No attempt will be made in this document to argue that this is of utilitarian
benefit. There is plenty of evidence that this is the case, but that's beside
the point of this document. 

The focus and inspiration is the Sudbury model. But these points no doubt
apply to other models.
